			<p>In this century, the invention of technology changes people’s life. People could easily participate in some activities, and they believe that technology have some negative impacts for social relationship. However, other people think that technology aids them to communicate more effectively than previous years.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="card">
			<h2>POSITIVE EFFECTS</h2>
			<p>Some people give opinions that technology has a tendency to reduce people to face-to-face because some sophisticated tools encourage people do not need to make appointments to meet in some places. Also, people seem busy with their smartphone. It could influences relationship between societies and environment. Based on some researches, people tend to pay particular attention toward their mobile gadgets than real friends. That phenomenon is called by blind relationship. For instance, some students are more familiar with several social media websites such as Facebook and Twitter than their classmates. It is true that development of technology gives strong effect for some people who live in this modern era.</p>

			<div class="card">
			<h2>NEGATIVE EFFECTS</h2>
			<p>Other people argue that high technology supports them, and people feel more convenient to interact with some relatives, friends, and acquaintances rather than in the past. They could access through some messaging services that are provided by telecommunication companies. Some people take advantages from this situation. For example, businessmen use Blackberry messaging to keep in touch with their business partners. They agree that it is a way to maintain relationship among them.</p>

			<div class="card">
			<h2>MY VIEWS</h2>
			<p>n my point of view, technology takes important role in this century and gives many benefits for societies. Besides, technology is accessible for everyone such as teenagers and businessmen. Some effects also occur for people either benefit effects or drawback effects. Users should control technology for supporting their activities and do not let technology control them because technology is created merely to facilitate people’s life.
